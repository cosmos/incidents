# v23.1.1 Coordinated Upgrade

## Date

2025-04-14

## Authors

Hypha and Interchain Labs

## Status

cosmoshub-4 is running Gaia `v23.1.1`

## Summary

The chain halted for almost four hours after validators upgraded to a new version at different block heights.


## Impact

Many validators had to rollback their node state to produce the canonical app hash.

## Root Causes

Non-deterministic behaviour in node-stopping mechanisms used to stage upgrades: both _halt-height_ and _Cosmovisor add-upgrade_ resulted in different hashes (see the [Supporting Information](#supporting-information) for survey results).

## Trigger

Validators upgrading from v23.0.1 to v23.1.1 at different block heights.

## Resolution

A canonical hash was identified and validators with the wrong one were asked to rollback their nodes and apply the upgrade one block early.

## Detection

Consensus issue was immediately noticed and reported by multiple validators.

## Action Items

* Hypha: Make proposal to reduce governance voting period parameters to allow for expedited proposals to coordinate halt height in an emergency
* Hypha: Test impact of pruning configuration in rollback command to reduce rollback time
* Hypha: Investigate sdk-level features to eliminate manual halt-height upgrades altogether
* Hypha + ICL: Investigate source of non-deterministic behaviour
* Hypha + ICL: Write and publish informational blog post about upgrade styles and improving the Hub upgrade process over time
* ICL: Define a critical emergency process between Interchain Labs <> Hypha (from [parent retro](https://github.com/interchainio/incidents/blob/main/ibc/2025/0409_galaxy.md))

## Lessons Learned

### What went well

- The chain came back
- No exploits were exploited
- â…” of the chain executed the instructions as published
- Validators were helping each other and encouraging some patience
- Rollback mechanism was recently tested and demonstrated in testnet Tuesday events designed to prepare validators for this situation

### What went wrong

- Following published instructions led to two different hashes
- Validators had trouble interpreting the log error ("Expected" vs "got" language led to people rolling back when they shouldn't have)
- Rollback process didn't go well: it took a long time for nodes to rollback (>30m was fairly normal)
  - Default pruning parameters are too high
  - Validators get tempted to cancel the rollback (they want more verbose logs)
- Some validators have challenges executing operations that are somewhat unique, especially large exchanges with strict protocols
- Rollback is an issue for validators using distributed/remote signers - once a hash is set, they cannot switch to a different one in order to avoid double-signing
- Lack of information sharing between the team patching the vulnerability and the team coordinating the chain led to the decision to call an emergency upgrade
- Breakdown in communication about what was state breaking at what point
- Peering issues after re-sync: some validators were having issues connecting to multiple/enough peers
- Hard to decide which hash is the canonical one: picking the hash with the higher VP relied on data provided from validators

### Where we got lucky
- Not enough people running remote signers
- Clear split between the different hashes - 45% vs 29% makes it easy to choose the canonical one
- This consensus tool was helpful: https://itrocket.net/services/mainnet/cosmoshub/analytics/consensus/
