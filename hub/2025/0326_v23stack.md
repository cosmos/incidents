### What went well

### What went wrong

* Runtime SIGSEGV errors happened with the new build. We still don't know their root cause.
* Some validators were running v22.2.0 and v22.3.0 instead of v22.3.1.
* Some nodes stopped one block short of the upgrade height.
  * Validators that set a halt height of 25002500 for a governance upgrade set to 25002500 end up upgrading at 25002499.
