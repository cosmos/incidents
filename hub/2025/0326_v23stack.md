# v23.0.0 Shipped with Executable Stack

## Date

## Status

v23.0.1 is deployed, but a few validators can't build it on their own. Their binaries produce segmentation faults.
The workaround that was shared in Discord for the SEGFAULTS produces an executable stack.

## Summary

v23.0.0 shipped with an executable stack.

## Impact

None because we didn't deploy it. Potential impact: surface area of attack increased.
We would have been one buffer overflow away (in any dependency) from a remote code execution buffet.

We annoyed our validators with a last-minute update.

## Root Causes

* BLST library added, missing exec stack flags
   * There are no production-ready rust crates that do this, so we call back into the binary
   * blst library version was really old
        * It's a transitive dependency of prismatic labs, [prism v5.2](github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/v5)
        * We can't update prism v5.2 yet because it requires go 1.24, which requires the SDK, etc to go to 1.24

## Trigger

We scheduled an update to v23.0.0 and validators went to build the binary.

## Resolution

We pushed a v23.0.1 with -z noexecstack as a linker flag, and it built as a non-executable stack.

## Detection

Validators went to build v23.0.0 and saw a concerning warning and raised the alarm.

## Action Items

* ICL to update blst library via go mod edit -replace
  * Team to push up v23.0.2
  * Hypha to verify v23.0.2 on the provider testnet
  * There may be an upcoming security patch that's conflicting with this
* ICL to add Werror to fail builds on linker warnings
* ICL to figure out bump to go 1.24 to update prism
* ICL to open an issue in the SDK so that every way of halting a node halts on the exact same block
* Figure out what the constraints are for CPU architectures that can/can't run gaiad
   * Hypha to offer points in exchange for info on CPU architectures
* Hypha to update workflows to compile the new binary, mirroring how most validators operate

## Lessons Learned

### What went well

* We're good at pushing out a last-minute binary swap
* Validators helping each other, great camaraderie
* Validators who had a bad upgrade from stopping one block short were able to downgrade, do the next block, and upgrade

### What went wrong

* Runtime SIGSEGV errors happened with the new build. We still don't know their root cause.
* Some validators were running v22.2.0 and v22.3.0 instead of v22.3.1.
* Some nodes stopped one block short of the upgrade height.
  * Validators that set a halt height of 25002500 for a governance upgrade set to 25002500 end up upgrading at 25002499.
  * Some people manually set halt-height because their alerting systems depend on it
  * Halt-height has a fence-post confusion, it stops the node one block short of the specified halt-height
* Multiple people saw the warning and didn't think "this is a show stopper"
* Warnings get ignored because WASM produces a bunch of (unavoidable?) warnings
* Hypha wrote this error off when we did the mini-testnet
* There was some confusion as to whether it was preventing it from compiling.
  * Maybe several concentric errors?
* Prop passed on Tuesday, upgrade scheduled for Wednesday.
  * Usually, the prop would pass on Friday
* We should have initiated incident response as soon as any new warnings were appearing

### Where we got lucky

* We didn't deploy it!
* We had JUST enough time to fix it. Right on the dot.

## Supporting information

### Build warnings

```bash
/usr/bin/ld: warning: static_code.o: missing .note.GNU-stack section implies executable stack
/usr/bin/ld: NOTE: This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the linker
```

### Runtime errors

**SIGILL error:**

```bash
Caught SIGILL in blst_cgo_init, consult <blst>/bindings/go/README.md.
```

**SIGSEGV error:**

```bash
SIGSEGV: segmentation violation
PC=0x8094530 m=0 sigcode=2 addr=0x8094530
```

### Store version mismatch error

```bash
failed to load latest version: failed to load latest version: version of store 08-wasm mismatch root store's version; expected 25002499 got 0; new stores should be added using StoreUpgrades
```

### Environment variables fix for SIGILL

```bash
ENV CGO_ENABLED=1
ENV CGO_CFLAGS="-O2 -D__BLST_PORTABLE__"
ENV GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar
```
